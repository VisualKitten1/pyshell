# PyShell
PyShell is a Python CLI-based OS which barely needs any external modules to be installed.
<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Flexible auto-installer for non-installed modules</li>
<li>Works on almost all systems</li>
<li>Requires no internet to function</li>
<li>Readable open-source code</li>
<li>Modular applications</li>
..and much more!
<h2>Developers</h2>
<li>VisualKitten (Discord: snow.#6834)</li>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>When you first boot PyShell, it will automatically do a first-time setup. Each time you get an update from Github, you will lose all of your data. We are working on a custom updater so this won't happen. Ofcourse it's gonna be hard.</p>
